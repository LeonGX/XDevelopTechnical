# Technical Test XDevelop

This is a technical test for a Software Intern job.

## Documentation

The technologies used for this test were: 
```
-HTML
-SCSS (SASS)
```
Other extensions used:
```
-Live Server (For rendering purposes)
-SASS Compiler 
```

## SASS Compiler
In order to use SASS without any additional installation, I took the liberty to use an extension to compile things faster. 

Please feel free to make any comments.
